As a researcher, I am currently focused in developing efficient point cloud processing techniques leveraging ideas from graph representation learning and fiddling with some Bayesian approaches every now and then. Outside of work, I am an amateur photography and editing enthusiast. Don't forget to [check out](#mm) some of my clicks!
